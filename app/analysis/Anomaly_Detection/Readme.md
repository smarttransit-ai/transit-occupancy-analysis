# Anomaly Detection

We use public transportation data from Nashville and Chattanooga to train models that can detect or identify anomalies in some variables of interest. In this study we assume that anomalies can represent either "anomalous" values (*e.g.*, high number of board counts) or possible malfunctions in the count passenger sensors.
