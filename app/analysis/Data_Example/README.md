# Readme

This folder some data to run the notebooks in the `Related_Notebooks` folder. The data was extracted from `route_id == '4'`, `direction_id == '0'`, and `stop_id == '12'`:

* `xPre_train_board_x.csv`
* `xPre_test_board_x.csv`
* `xPost_train_board_x.csv`
* `xPost_test_board_x.csv`

Also, notice that the notebooks in the `Related_Notebooks` folder correspond to our initial modeling approaches, and thus they only have the following variables:

* `board_count`
* `month`
* `service_kind`
* `hour`
* `mean_temp`
* `mean_precip`
* `surrounding_board_count`
